## Exploring a sample of 20 000 Ask and Show posts with Comments in Hacker News

In this second (guided) project of the [#DataScientist path in Dataquest](https://app.dataquest.io/dashboard).

Find below the summary of this quest:

* We set a goal for the project.
* We collected (here we used provided for the project) and sorted the data.
* We reformatted and cleaned the data to prepare it for analysis.
* We analyzed the data.

#### Key take aways

* Practice makes loops perfect
* Datetime module is a powerful tool, once you establish the difference between strptime and strftime.
* Code by chunks meaning for each task, debug while moving forward using print statements. It took me like a good thirty minutes to 
debug a block of code because of that.
* Try! Try! Try! Until you can't get away with syntax anymore. It's only you, the IDE and your computer.That's how I tryly understood the Do Not Repeat yourself acronym today.

PS: the questions below are the next step that can be taken for our dataset.
Determine if show or ask posts receive more points on average.
Determine if posts created at a certain time are more likely to receive more points.
Compare your results to the average number of comments and points other posts receive.
