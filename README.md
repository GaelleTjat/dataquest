# dataquest

This is a [Dataquest]() project in my Python Quest
In this project, we went through a complete data science workflow:

* We started by clarifying the goal of our project.
* We collected relevant data.
* We cleaned the data to prepare it for analysis.
* We analyzed the cleaned data.
* We offered a recommendation for an app Profile for both App Store and Android Store.

May the quest continue
